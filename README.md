## Notes

Updating the supabase database from interacting with elements on the website (such as the upvote counter) took the longest. The issue ended up being not with code, but with policies for the supabase project that had to be enabled to allow updates. Figuring out how to update the site in real-time to reflect the updated database's information was also challenging.
